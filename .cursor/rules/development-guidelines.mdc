# Development Guidelines

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Next.js App Router patterns
- Strapi 5 API structure (no `attributes` nesting, use `documentId`)

## API Patterns
- Use API proxy routes to avoid CORS issues
- Bearer token authentication for Strapi
- Handle loading states and error boundaries
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces

## Assessment Logic
- Tags are calculated based on user answers
- Each tag has a recommendation with title, content, and tutorialLink
- Priority-based sorting (high, medium, low)
- Category-based organization
