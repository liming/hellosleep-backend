# Important Notes

## Strapi 5 Differences
- Uses `documentId` instead of `id` for relations
- Data is not nested under `attributes`
- API structure fundamentally different from Strapi 4

## Environment Setup
- **Strapi**: `http://localhost:1337`
- **Next.js**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Strapi 5
- **API Token**: Stored in `service/.env` as `LOCAL_API_TOKEN`

## Common Commands
```bash
# Start development servers
npm run dev

# Start individual services
cd service && npm run develop
cd web && npm run dev

# Build and test
npm run build
npm run test
```

## Critical Issues
- API proxy is essential for client-side Strapi calls to avoid CORS
- Assessment system uses static, rule-based calculations (no AI)
- Tutorial links have been migrated to new format but need route conflict resolution

## Documentation
- **TODO.md**: Main project TODO list with completed tasks and current priorities
- **Always update TODO.md** when completing tasks or changing priorities
- **Cursor Rules**: Located in `.cursor/rules/` directory with `.mdc` extension
