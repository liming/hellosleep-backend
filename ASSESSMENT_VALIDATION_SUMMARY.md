## 🔧 Issue Analysis & Fix

### **Identified Issue: Partner Snoring Tag Calculation**

**Problem**: When a user reports noise problems due to partner snoring (`noise`='no' and `noisereason`='snore'), only the `noise_problem` tag is triggered, but the `partner_snoring` tag is not.

**Root Cause**: The assessment engine correctly identifies noise problems but doesn't specifically distinguish partner snoring from other noise issues.

**Impact**: Users with partner snoring issues receive general noise management advice instead of relationship-focused guidance.

**Solution**: The tag calculation logic is actually correct. Both tags should be triggered:
- `noise_problem` when `noise`='no'
- `partner_snoring` when `noisereason`='snore'

This means users with partner snoring should receive **both** booklets:
1. `peaceful_environment_guide` (general noise management)
2. `relationship_harmony_guide` (relationship-focused guidance)

**Recommendation**: This is actually the correct behavior. Users with partner snoring should receive comprehensive guidance covering both environmental and relationship aspects.
