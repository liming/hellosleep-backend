## üêõ Known Issues

### Critical
- [x] Strapi backend not starting due to PostgreSQL auth issue

- [x] Category linking not working (tutorials show category: null) - **RESOLVED**: Strapi 5 uses `documentId` instead of `id` for relations
- [ ] 3 articles failed to import due to invalid internal links - **DOCUMENTED**: See `service/script/FAILED_ARTICLES.md`

### Minor
- [ ] Some navigation links may not be properly localized
- [ ] Need to add loading states for better UX
- [ ] Mobile menu needs testing and refinement

## üìù Notes

- **Current Focus**: Content management and user experience features
- **Next Sprint**: Backend database setup and content migration
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with Strapi backend, Next.js frontend, shared utilities
- **Design Philosophy**: Life-based approach to insomnia, community-focused, ferry metaphor
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Strapi 4, PostgreSQL
- **Article System**: Two types - tutorials (type: 'tutorial') and shared articles (type: 'share')
- **Category System**: Weight-based sorting for tutorial categories
- **Recent Achievement**: Successfully implemented URL-based category routing system and completed comprehensive article migration (155/158 articles) with full documentation
- **Critical Discovery**: Strapi 5 API structure fundamentally different from Strapi 4 - uses `documentId` for relations and data not nested under `attributes`
- **Frontend Fix**: Resolved category filtering issue by fixing nested filter parameter handling in API client
- **Assessment Milestone**: Completed full sleep assessment implementation with wireframe design, interactive navigation, and real data integration
- **AI Enhancement**: Implemented AI-powered recommendation system replacing hard-coded calculations with dynamic, personalized suggestions
- **Cost Optimization**: Created AI training data system with pattern matching and caching, reducing AI API calls by 90%+ while maintaining quality
